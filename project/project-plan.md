# Project Plan

## Summary

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->
This Data Engineering project analyzes the correlation between the frequency of checks conducted on air transport of dangerous goods and the number of accidents that occur. Using a dataset on the frequency of checks and the number of accidents, we will perform statistical analysis and develop predictive models to identify any correlations and improve safety in the transportation of dangerous goods. The insights gained from this project can inform policy decisions and resource allocation in the transportation industry.

## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->
This Data Engineering project aims to identify the correlation between the frequency of checks and the number of accidents in air transport of dangerous goods. The insights gained from this project can help inform policy decisions regarding the optimal frequency of checks needed to ensure safety in the transportation of dangerous goods. This could lead to more efficient resource allocation and a reduction in accidents and injuries, increasing public trust in the safety of air transport.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
